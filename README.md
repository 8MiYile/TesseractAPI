# Tesseract: 3D Network Graph Library for Java

This API is for the General purpose of building graphs consisting of nodes and connectors that are divided into groups and grids. 
Groups are sets of nodes and connectors that are located next to each other and may not necessarily have a connection. 
Grids are already sets of connectors connected to each other which can be several in a group.

Its main purpose is to help create systems for exchanging information between nodes with simplified calculations. 
The library also allows you to create controllers for each group that will be responsible for the logic. 
The API is written without using additional libraries other than FastUtils.
